### Next-Auth
This project handles authentication for the users using next-auth and jwt.

To add a field into the table User, you have to modify the following files :
- `auth.d.ts` at the root level,
- `lib/prisma/auth.ts`,
and the route/component where you want to show the new information.

To only add an info to the table user, change the `Ã¬nterface user` and then the profile info in the `lib/prisma/auth.ts` file, to get a new info in the session, change both the `jwt` and the `session interface` in the `auth.d.ts` and the info you get in the `auth.ts` file.
